Based on these contrasting examples, what is the key semantic or linguistic pattern that distinguishes the positive examples from the negative examples? What concept, structure, or meaning does this feature seem to detect vs. inhibit?

Format your response as:
Pattern: [concise description of what the feature detects in positive examples vs. what it inhibits in negative examples]
EXPLANATION: [brief explanation of the contrast and why this pattern makes sense]
