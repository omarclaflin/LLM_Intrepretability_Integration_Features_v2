Pattern: The positive examples contain the word "real" in the sense of reality, actuality, or the physical world, while the negative examples contain the word "that" introducing a subordinate clause.

EXPLANATION: The key distinguishing factor seems to be the presence of the word "real" in the positive examples, used to refer to actual reality, physical existence, or the realm of human experience, as opposed to the imaginary, symbolic or divine. In contrast, the negative examples do not contain this sense of "real" but rather use the common word "that" to introduce subordinate clauses describing various facts or possibilities. So this feature appears to be detecting the semantic concept of reality/actuality via the specific word "real", while inhibiting the grammatical construction of subordinate clauses starting with "that".
