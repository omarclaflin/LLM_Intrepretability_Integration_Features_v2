I was 6 years old. My family and I had gone hiking in the woods of New Hampshire. There were no trails or paths in those woods. You simply followed the sound of the birds and the buzz of insects.
We had hiked for several hours when I spotted the dragonfly. I was immediately struck by its beauty. It was a little larger than my hand. I was shocked that it could fly! It was a miracle! It was a miracle that a beautiful creature could be so graceful and strong.
The dragonfly seemed to speak to me. I knew I wanted to do something to help him. I wanted to protect him and help him.
I knew that I would have to become a warrior for him. This was my calling.
