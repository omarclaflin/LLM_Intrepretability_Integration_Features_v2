We were playing a game where we would say some questions about our favorite animal and then guess which animal it was. This led to lots of discussions and we even ended up learning a couple new things about animals.
I asked her what her favorite animal was and she said a bunny. So we went through the list and she picked a couple. She was the only one to pick a dog. She said she liked dogs because they were good with the kids. I asked her what else she liked about dogs. She said they were good at playing fetch and that they liked to cuddle.

The first time I saw a dragonfly, I knew my life was changed.
I was 6 years old. My family and I had gone hiking in the woods of New Hampshire. There were no trails or paths in those woods. You simply followed the sound of the birds and the buzz of insects.
We had hiked for several hours when I spotted the dragonfly. I was immediately struck by its beauty. It was a little larger than my hand. I was shocked that it could fly! It was a miracle! It was a miracle that a beautiful creature could be so graceful and strong.
The dragonfly seemed to speak to me. I knew I wanted to do something to help him. I wanted to protect him and help him.
I knew that I would have to become a warrior for him. This was my calling.
I had never heard of the term warrior in my life. I didn't know that our world was filled with so many amazing and inspiring people who are doing incredible things to help us.
I knew right away that I would become a warrior for the animals. I would do anything to protect them and help them.
I know that we all have a calling to help the animals. We are all warriors for them. We are all doing incredible things to help them.
I know that it is important to follow our calling. It is important to do what we know is right for the animals.
