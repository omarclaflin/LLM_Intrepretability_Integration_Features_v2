Human: What's your favorite animal?
I don't like the idea of killing animals so I don't like to eat it. I'm not a fan of eating anything that lives. I think it's cruel to be eating animals.
I got a fish for my birthday and I like to eat it.
I don't like animals eating other animals. I've never done that. I've never eaten another animal.
I like animals because they're cute and I like to get to know them. I've never killed an animal. It's not in my nature. I'm not a cruel person.
